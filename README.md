# holbertonschool-cyber_security

Entry-level cybersecurity exercises and scripts for Holberton students. Each directory holds small Bash utilities that mirror common security tasks (system info, password generation, hashing, process monitoring, key creation).

## Layout
- `cybersecurity_basics/0x00_introduction_cybersecurity/`: introductory scripts for the first cybersecurity module.

## How to use
- Run scripts directly (e.g., `./1-gen_password.sh 20`) after making them executable with `chmod +x file`.
- Read each subdirectory README for task details and constraints.
